     * You can delete one analysis at a time.
     * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
     * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
     *
     * When you list the analyses for a repository,
     * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
     *
     * ```
     * "deletable": true
     * ```
     *
     * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
     * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
     * for each enabled code scanning tool,
     * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
     *
     * * `ref`
     * * `tool`
     * * `category`
     *
     * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
     * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
     *
     * ```
     * Analysis specified is not deletable.
     * ```
     *
     * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
     * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
     * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
     * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
     * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
     * for the specified tool in your repository.
     * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
     * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
     * in the 200 response is `null`.
     *
     * As an example of the deletion process,
     * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
     * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
     * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
     * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
     * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
     * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
     * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
     * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
     * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
     * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
     * Then repeat the process for the second set.
     * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
     *
     * **Outer loop**:
     * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
     * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
     *
     *   **Inner loop**:
     *   * Delete the identified analysis.
     *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
     *
     * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

     * For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:
     *
     * ```
     * Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
     * ```
     *
     * Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."

     * The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [repository invitations API endpoints](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#invitations).
     *
     * **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**
     *
     * The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level changed.

     * **Rate limits**
     *
     * You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

     * #### If the content is a directory
     * The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.

     * describing the symlink itself.

     * #### If the content is a submodule
     * The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
     * commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
     * the submodule at that specific commit.

     * Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
     *
     * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
     * before we merge a pull request.
     *
     * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
     * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
     * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
     *
     * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
     * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
     * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
     * return a failure response.
     *
     * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
     * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
     * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
     * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
     *
     * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
     * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
     *
     * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
     * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
     * application with debugging enabled.
     *
     * Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.
     *
     * #### Merged branch response
     * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
     * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
     * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
     * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
     * *   There are no merge conflicts
     *
     * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
     * response.
     *
     * #### Merge conflict response
     * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
     * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
     *
     * #### Failed commit status checks
     * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
     * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

     * **Import status**
     *
     * This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
     *
     * An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
     *
     * *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
     * *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
     * *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
     * *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
     * *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
     *
     * If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
     *
     * *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
     * *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
     * *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     *
     * **The project_choices field**
     *
     * When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
     *
     * **Git LFS related fields**
     *
     * This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
     *
     * *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
     * *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
     * *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
     * *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

     *
     * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).
     *
     * For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:
     *
     * `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`

     * #### Considerations for code search
     *
     * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
     *
     * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
     * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
     * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
     * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

     *
     * The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
     *
     * The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
     *
     * **Working with large comparisons**
     *
     * To process a response with a large number of commits, you can use (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using paging, the list of changed files is only returned with page 1, but includes all changed files for the entire comparison. For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."
     *
     * When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.
     *
     * **Signature verification object**
     *
     * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
     *
     * | Name | Type | Description |
     * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
     * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
     * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
     * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
     * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
     *
     * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
     *
     * | Value | Description |
     * | ----- | ----------- |
     * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
     * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
     * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
     * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
     * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
     * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
     * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
     * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
     * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
     * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
     * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
     * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
     * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

       * @example # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
       *
       * ## Our Pledge
       *
       * In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
       *
       * ## Our Standards
       *
       * Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
       *
       * * Using welcoming and inclusive language
       * * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
       * * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
       * * Focusing on what is best for the community
       * * Showing empathy towards other community members
       *
       * Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
       *
       * * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
       * * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
       * * Public or private harassment
       * * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
       * * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
       *
       * ## Our Responsibilities
       *
       * Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
       *                   to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
       *
       * Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
       *
       * ## Scope
       *
       * This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
       *                   posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
       *
       * ## Enforcement
       *
       * Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
       *
       * Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
       *
       * ## Attribution
       *
       * This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]
